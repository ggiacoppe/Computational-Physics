# Assignment based on UAlbany course PHY 477/577

1. MC-electron-simulation in C++ demonstrates multiple collision of high energy electrons with reference to respective data on NIST ESTAR website.
2. Random Number Generator compares a random number generated seed.
3. Special Realitivity is a mini program that asks user to enter a velocity, time, length, mass to output a value related to speed of light.
4. Single MC 1-D integration (single-valued function of y versus x) integrate (full area under the curve).
5. Draft-Program to compute age of the universe & 4 cases: case 1 cold matter, case 2 relative matter radiation, case 3 intrinsic curve, case 4 dark energy. *disclaimer: very rough draft output is off in magnitude!!*
